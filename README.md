# ArenaDiscreteEventSimulation
Descriptive Model of a Production System
##Description
This project contains a complete model of a complex manufacturing assembly line using the Arena Discrete Event Simulation (DES) software. The main file "CIW Complete" is the complete model and the additional txt files are schedules to be read into the model at various workstations. The file locations must be updated if the model is to be run on a local system.
